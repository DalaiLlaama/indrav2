   * event data. The second was used to store any subsequent updates.

   * The store entry for `channel/{multisigAddr1}` will have a free balance
   * instance, while the store entry for `channel/{multisigAddr2}` will have
   * all subsequent information regarding channel updates (i.e proposed apps).
   *
   * While this may not be a problem for the functioning of *all* channels,
   * it will be a problem for *any* channel that is restored from the hub.
   * This is because the channels restored by the hub search for the outdated
   * channel state stored under the path `channel/{multisigAddr1}`. It is likely
   * that other, older channels are also affected by this bug.
   *
   * This method will pull out any channel that has a multisigAddress in the
   * channel table, that is different from the expected multisigAddress.
   *
   * Related to bug described in `getNoFreeBalance`.
